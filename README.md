km = miles*1.60934
(32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
°C = (°F - 32) ÷ 9/5
S.I. = (P × R × T)/100, where P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest in % per annum, and T = Time, usually calculated as the number of years. The rate of interest is in percentage R% (and is to be written as R/100, thus 100 in the formula).
